## Getting Started

First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/praty-1698/<NEW-REPO>
    $ cd NEW-REPO
    
Activate the virtualenv for your project.

    $ source <environment_directory>/bin/activate
    
Install project dependencies:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    
Then simply apply the migrations:
